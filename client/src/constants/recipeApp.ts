 * When true, UX is simplified for the mono-goal recipe app:
 * - Hide Agent Builder (creation/modification panel)
 * - Hide "Add multi-conversation" button
 * - Model selector shows only "My Agents" (no other providers)
 * - Hide "My files" in account menu
 * - Remove right side panel completely (and its "hide panel" setting)
 * - Hide "Exemples" (Presets) button
